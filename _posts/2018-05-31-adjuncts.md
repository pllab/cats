We will wrap up chapter 4 for this week's reading group. Here's what we plan to do:

  - Show how data migration can be modeled using pullbacks
  - Discuss the definition of adjunction
  - Describe several types of database operations in terms of functors
  - Introduce products, limits, and cones

This section is quite dense with definitions, so I'll try my best to explain what they mean and how they all relate.
